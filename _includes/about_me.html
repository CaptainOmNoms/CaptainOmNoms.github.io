    		<p>
            I have over 8 years of experience as a software engineer, academically and professionally.
            Over those years I have worked with many different languages and frameworks,
            however my language of preference is Python. Over the last 3 years I have been working at
            Fidessa Corp, as a Service Delivery Engineer.</p>
        <p>
           I love building things and solving problems.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real world problems that come up in my day to day,
           as is evident in my personal projects.
           I'm looking for a developer role which would allow me to create solutions to other people's real world problems,
           and gain experience with architecture and project management.
